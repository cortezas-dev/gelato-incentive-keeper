# Gelato Incentive Keeper

This repository is created as part of my request to be added to the Gelato Web3 Functions (TypeScript) allowlist.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a simple **incentive keeper bot** using Gelato.  
The bot will execute tasks automatically, covering gas fees with USDC and earning back tips as incentives.  

## Use Case
- Run 24/7 automation using Gelato Web3 Functions.  
- Monitor gas usage and tips received.  
- Demonstrate the usage of Gelato’s automation tools for personal projects.  

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript  
- Gelato Web3 Functions  
- Solidity (for testing smart contract interactions)

This repo is not production-ready; it’s just a proof-of-concept for educational and allowlist purposes.
